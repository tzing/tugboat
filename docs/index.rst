Argo Workflows Manifest
+++++++++++++++++++++++

To get started, find an Argo Workflow manifest that contains an error.
For example, the following manifest has an invalid entrypoint:

.. code-block:: yaml
   :caption: whalesay.yaml
   :linenos:
   :emphasize-lines: 6

   apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
   kind: Workflow
   metadata:
     generateName: test-
   spec:
     entrypoint: ducksay
     templates:
       - name: whalesay
         inputs:
           parameters:
             - name: message
               value: Hello Argo!
         container:
           image: docker/whalesay:latest
           command: [cowsay]
           args:
             - "{{ inputs.parameters.message }}"


Run :octicon:`rocket`
+++++++++++++++++++++

Lint your workflow manifest by running:

.. code-block:: bash

   tugboat whalesay.yaml

This will output the following:

.. code-block:: none

   WF201 Invalid entrypoint
     @whalesay.yaml:6:15 (test-)

     4 |   generateName: test-
     5 | spec:
     6 |   entrypoint: ducksay
       |               ^^^^^^^
       |               ‚îî WF201 at .spec.entrypoint
     7 |   templates:
     8 |     - name: whalesay

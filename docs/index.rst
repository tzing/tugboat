Installation
------------

Tugboat is available on PyPI as `argo-tugboat`_. You can install it using pip:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install argo-tugboat

.. _argo-tugboat: https://pypi.org/project/argo-tugboat/


Usage
-----

This tool introduces a command, ``tugboat``, which you can use to lint your Argo Workflows manifests.

.. code-block:: bash

   tugboat

This command will, by default, lint all ``.yaml`` or ``.yml`` files in the current directory.
You can also specify particular files to lint by passing them as arguments:

.. code-block:: bash

   tugboat file1.yaml file2.yaml


Example
-------

For instance, if you have a manifest file named ``whalesay.yaml`` with the following content:

.. code-block:: yaml
   :linenos:
   :caption: whalesay.yaml

   apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
   kind: Workflow
   metadata:
     generateName: test-
   spec:
     entrypoint: ducksay
     templates:
       - name: whalesay
         container:
           image: docker/whalesay:latest
           command: [cowsay]
           args: ["hello world"]

The command will output the following:

.. code-block:: none

   whalesay.yaml:6:3: WF001 Invalid entrypoint

    4 |   generateName: test-
    5 | spec:
    6 |   entrypoint: ducksay

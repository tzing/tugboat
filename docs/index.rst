- üìò Argo Workflow Support
   - Designed to align with Argo Workflow specifications, Tugboat ensures compatibility with supported versions of Argo.

- üöÄ Lightweight and Fast
   - Tugboat integrates seamlessly into your development workflow, offering quick feedback without compromising your pace.

- üìä Actionable Insights
   - Clear, actionable error messages and warnings to help you fix issues efficiently.

.. note::

   Tugboat in currently in development and may not yet cover every use case or workflow configuration.

   While Tugboat provides valuable linting capabilities, certain rules may be overly strict or aggressive in their assessments.
   We are eager to hear from users like you ‚Äî your feedback will directly influence how we refine and improve Tugboat.


Quick Start
-----------

To get started with Tugboat, you can install it using pip:

Install Tugboat
+++++++++++++++

Tugboat requires Python 3.12 or later (download from the `Python website <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_ if needed).

The package is available on PyPI as `argo-tugboat`_. Install it using pip:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install argo-tugboat

.. _argo-tugboat: https://pypi.org/project/argo-tugboat/


Prepare workflow manifest
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

Make sure you have an Argo Workflow manifest ready. It should be a valid YAML file.

For testing, you can use this minimal example:

.. code-block:: yaml
   :caption: whalesay.yaml
   :linenos:
   :emphasize-lines: 6,17

   apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
   kind: Workflow
   metadata:
     generateName: test-
   spec:
     entrypoint: ducksay
     templates:
       - name: whalesay
         inputs:
           parameters:
             - name: message
               value: Hello Argo!
         container:
           image: docker/whalesay:latest
           command: [cowsay]
           args:
             - "{{ inputs.parameters.messages }}"

This manifest has two issues:

- The entrypoint ``ducksay`` is not defined in any template.
- The parameter reference is typo; it should be ``message`` instead of ``messages``.

Save this as ``whalesay.yaml``.


Run Tugboat
+++++++++++

Lint your workflow manifest by running:

.. code-block:: bash

   tugboat whalesay.yaml

This will output a list of issues found in the manifest:

.. code-block:: none

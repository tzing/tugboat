Quick Start
-----------

To get started with Tugboat, you can install it using pip:

Install Tugboat
+++++++++++++++

Tugboat requires Python 3.12 or later (download from the `Python website <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_ if needed).

The package is available on PyPI as `argo-tugboat`_. Install it using pip:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install argo-tugboat

.. _argo-tugboat: https://pypi.org/project/argo-tugboat/


Prepare workflow manifest
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

Make sure you have an Argo Workflow manifest ready. It should be a valid YAML file.

For testing, you can use this minimal example which has a few issues:

.. code-block:: yaml
   :caption: whalesay.yaml
   :linenos:

   apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
   kind: Workflow
   metadata:
     generateName: test-
   spec:
     templates:
       - name: whalesay
         inputs:
           parameters:
             - name: message
               value: Hello Argo!
         container:
           image: docker/whalesay:latest
           command: [cowsay]
           args:
             - "{{ inputs.parameters.messages }}" # typo: parameter's'

Save this as ``whalesay.yaml``.


Run Tugboat
+++++++++++

Lint your workflow manifest by running:

.. code-block:: bash

   tugboat whalesay.yaml

This will output a list of issues found in the manifest:

.. code-block:: none

   whalesay.yaml:5:1: M004 Missing required field 'entrypoint'

    3 | metadata:
    4 |   generateName: test-
    5 | spec:
      | ‚îî M004 at .spec.entrypoint in test-
    6 |   templates:
    7 |     - name: whalesay

      Field 'entrypoint' is required in the 'spec' section but missing

   whalesay.yaml:16:13: VAR002 Invalid reference

       |              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
       |              ‚îî VAR002 at .spec.templates.0.container.args.0 in test-

       The parameter reference 'inputs.parameters.messages' used in template 'whalesay' is invalid.

       Do you mean: {{ inputs.parameters.message }}
